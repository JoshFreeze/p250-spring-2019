# Examples

Contained here are the examples used throughout the semester.
The examples will be updated weekly.

You should download these notebooks and explore them yourself!

A brief description of each example follows.

- **Numbers_and_Precision.ipynb**:
This shows the main difficulty with numerical work -- finite precision!
- **Algorithm_Choice.ipynb**:
An example showing that all mathematically equivalent algorithms do not behave the same way numerically.
- **Animated_Root_Finding.ipynb**:
Simple animations of some root finding algorithms.  The code in this notebook is beyond the scope of the course.  We will not have time to delve into the details of Python as used in this example.
- **Root_Finding.ipynb**:
An example showing the use of routines from `scipy.optimize` for one dimensional root finding using the shape of a soap file.
